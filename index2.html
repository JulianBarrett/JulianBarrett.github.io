    <h1>Elite Fitness</h1>

    <p>The idea behind this project was to create a forum for people to share ideas about fitness. For this project, I also focused on enhancing the platform's user engagement through thoughtful UX design and customization features. By integrating API calls through jQuery, I allowed users to easily access exercise suggestions tailored to specific muscle groups. This dynamic feature not only simplified the workout creation process but also empowered users to make more informed decisions based on their fitness goals. Additionally, I crafted the user interface using Bootstrap and CSS, making the platform both visually appealing and responsive, ensuring an intuitive and enjoyable experience for a diverse user base.
