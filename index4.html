    <h1>Linux Shell</h1>

    <p>I developed a command-line shell called dukesh, which involved implementing several core features across multiple phases. Initially, I created an interactive shell loop with support for batch processing and basic built-ins like echo and quit. I then expanded the shell by adding more built-in commands (cd, pwd, which) and utility programs (ls, head, cut), integrating process management with fork()/exec() for external programs. Environment variable handling was introduced with the export, unset, and env commands, along with support for variable expansion in echo. Finally, I implemented piping to handle streams between processes, allowing complex command chaining. This project strengthened my understanding of shell programming, process control, and inter-process communication.</p>
